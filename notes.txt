typescript = js + type system


1. catch error during developement
2. type annotations
3. ts complier does not provide any performance optimization


tsc (npm install -g typescript ts-node)


interface: structure of objects
type: it refers to a list of all the properties of any value


types:
  primitive (boolean, string,...) + object types (functions, arrays,....)

TYPE ANNOTATIONS: the developer tells to typescript the type
TYPE INFERENCES: declaration + initialisation. typescript understand the type
