typescript = js + type system


1. catch error during developement
2. type annotations
3. ts complier does not provide any performance optimization


tsc (npm install -g typescript ts-node)


interface: structure of objects
type: it refers to a list of all the properties of any value


types:
  primitive (boolean, string,...) + object types (functions, arrays,....)

TYPE ANNOTATIONS: the developer tells to typescript the type
TYPE INFERENCES: declaration + initialisation. typescript understand the type


Typescript is moduler and each module has it’s own block. So, basically if you could somehow enclose the variable which is declared as let within it’s own module, the error will be resolved because now your let variable is in it’s separate block.
To achieve this, simply type export on the top of your script or additionally you can type export {}. Now you will see that the error is resolved.
